# Notes

## To Do
- Minify bootstrap & possibly upgrade to latest v4.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo base_url('assets/front/css/bootstrap.css');?>" />

## Beautify
In VS Code Editor, following regular expression helped me to search blank lines to optimize + beautify files.

To achieve same in near future, search with `^(\s)*$\n` and select Use Regular Expression and replace with blank. And, you done!
